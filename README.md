# Northcoders News API

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Northcoders News API, a RESTful API designed as part of the Northcoders Backend Bootcamp. This project serves as the backend for a news website, providing the necessary endpoints for fetching and interacting with articles, comments, users, and topics. The API is built using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, and is fully hosted and accessible online.

## Key Features

- **Articles:** Fetch all articles, filter by topic, sort by various fields, and get a single article by ID.
- **Comments:** Add, fetch, and delete comments associated with specific articles.
- **Users:** Fetch user profiles by username.
- **Topics:** Fetch all available topics.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Clint700/Northcoders-Backend-Project.git
   cd Northcoders-Backend-Project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Environment Variables

Create environment variables files to store database connection strings:

1. **Development Environment:**
   
   Create a `.env.development` file:

   ```
   PGDATABASE=nc_news
   ```

2. **Test Environment:**

   Create a `.env.test` file:

   ```
   PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
   ```

3. **Production Environment:**

   Create a `.env.production` file:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>
   ```

   Replace `<user>`, `<password>`, `<host>`, `<port>`, and `<database>` with actual Supabase database credentials.

### Seeding the Database

To seed the development or production database:

```bash
npm run seed
```

For production seeding:

```bash
npm run seed-prod
```

### Running the Server

To start the server locally:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will be running at `http://localhost:9090/`.

## API Documentation

## Deployment

This API is hosted on Render and connected to a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase.

- **API Base URL:** [Render Hosted API](https://northcoders-backend-project.onrender.com/api)
- **Supabase Dashboard:** [Supabase Database](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qcihkqwrmqkgcwxkxwdy/database/tables)

The API is live and accessible at the Render URL, where you can interact with it using the provided endpoints.
